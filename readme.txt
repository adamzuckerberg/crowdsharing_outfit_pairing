Personal Shopper Tool:
	http://www.tradesy-outfits.com/

	This web application allows the addition of new items to a list of matched items via a swipe or click.

How to Use this Tool:
	1.) Navigate to www.tradesy-outfits.com

	2.) On the left is an image of an item.

	3.) On the right is the first of a collection of items to try to match to the item on the left.

	4.) Swipe-right towards the CEO (on desktops simply click on the CEO) to 'like' the item (i.e. you think it matches the primary item and creates an outfit). This creates an inventory of items in the database which are related as matches of the primary item. Instead of adding items with a form, Tradesy employees can simply use a swipe (or click) to add new items to the list of matches.

	5.) Swipe-left towards the woman with her tongue out (on desktops click on the woman) to 'dislike' the item if you think it does NOT match the primary item.

	6.) The next item to match will be revealed. Continue to match items by swiping/clicking.

	7.) Now click on the "Show Items" button to reveal all the items you have matched.  This section is a hybrid showing some elements of the employee view (top) and some elements of the user view (bottom).  The top section would be used by Tradesy Personal Shoppers to create the inventory. Users would see the 'ADD TO BAG' links in a section below the current "YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE" section on the www.tradesy.com website.

    8.) Items persist in the MySQL database. To delete all matched items and start over, click the "Clear Items" button.

Why did I Create the Personal Shopper Tool?

	User-Experience: The inspiration for this tool is that by having a Personal Shopper or friend recommend an item, a shopper's perceived risk may be lowered, increasing the likelihood of an upsell purchase.  In addition, the user achieves a great outfit rather than simply a single item - this is an added-value experience. Lastly, because of the uniqueness of any particular item on Tradesy, there is a psychological incentive to buy the recommended item while in the current checkout process rather than risk the item being purchased by another user.

	Business-Case: The Personal Shopper tool has the potential to increase average-revenue-per-checkout and total annual sales for Tradesy.  Users benefit from the added-value of achieving a matching outfit rather than simply an a-la-carte item. There may also be a potential for adding bundled pricing and discounting to incentivize users to purchase the outfit/package rather than simply the single item.

	Crowdsourced Recommendations: Unlike Amazon or similar sites which have depth of inventory and thus are able to run correlations between items and recommend items based on historical purchase behavior, I imagine that Tradesy has shallow inventory with many one-off items in limited quanitity since items are posted by users.  By crowdsourcing outfit recommendations, the Tradesy team or a group of fashion-forward Tradesy Personal Shoppers can always be matching items with a simple, fun, responsive user interface.  Style is an art, so accurate recommendations necessitate a labor-intensive process rather than a simple algorithm.  In other words, you would need a process to manually match an outfit (i.e. "Do these shoes go with that purse"? would be hard for a script to determine). This adding of a gamification layer with an easy, fun, Tinder-style swipe creates an inefficient process to create recommendations through crowd-sourcing.  The further potential exists to allow users to create matched items as well.

	Branding: In shopping and in life, if it's not a 'Hell Yes!', it's a 'Hell No!'
