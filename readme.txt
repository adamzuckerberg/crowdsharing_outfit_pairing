Personal Shopper Tool:
	http://www.tradesy-outfits.com/

How to Use the Tool:
	1.) Navigate to www.tradesy-outfits.com

	2.) On the left is an image of an item.

	3.) On the right is the first of a collection of items to try to match to the item on the left.

	4.) Swipe-right (on mobile devices) towards the CEO (on desktops simply click on the CEO) to 'like' (i.e. 'match') the item

	5.) Swipe-left (on mobile devices) towards the woman with her tongue out (on desktops click on the woman) to 'dislike' the item (i.e. you think it does NOT match the primary item).

	6.) The next item to match will be revealed. Continue to match items by swiping/clicking.

	7.) Now click on the "Show Items" button to reveal all the items you have matched.  This section is a hybrid showing some of the elements of the view (e.g. 'ADD TO BAG' links and hover effect) that would likely flow into a section below the current "YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE" section on the www.tradesy.com website.

    8.) Items persist in the db. To delete all matched items and start over, click the "Clear Items" button.

Why did I Create the Personal Shopper Tool?

	User-Experience: The inspiration for this tool is that by having a Personal Shopper or friend recommend an item, a shopper's perceived risk may be lowered, increasing the likelihood of an upsell purchase.  In addition, the user achieves a great outfit rather than simply a single item - this is an added value experience.  

	Business-Case: The Personal Shopper tool has the potential to increase average-revenue-per-checkout and total annual sales.  Users benefit from the added-value of achieving a matching outfit rather than simply a single item. There may also be a potential for adding bundled pricing and discounting.

	Crowdsourced Recommendations: Unlike Amazon or similar sites which have depth of inventory and thus are able to run correlations between items and recommend items based on what similar people have purchased, I am imagine that Tradesy has shallow inventory with many one-off items in limited quanitity.  By crowd-sourcing recommendations, the Tradesy team or a group of fashion-forward Personal Tradesy shoppers can always be matching items - adding a gamification layer may make it fun to match new items as they are added to inventort.  Plus, style is an art, so you need someone to manually match an item to determine if it's a match - "Do these shoes go with that purse"? would be hard for a script to determine so this is an inefficient process made somewhat more efficient through crowd-sourcing.

	Branding: I attempted to be on brand. Because in shopping and in life...if it's not a 'Hell Yes!' than it's a 'Hell No!'
